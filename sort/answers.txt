sort1 uses: Bubble sort!

How do you know?:

When I use sorted50000.txt and sorted5000.txt to distinguish Ω.
Always run time is sort1 < sort2 < sort3.
According to Big Ω formula of  Bubble sort when were sorted
that the runtime just need n instead Merge sort need nlog n,
n < n logn, then I know.

sort2 uses: Merge sort!

How do you know?:

When I use random50000.txt, because n is the large number and random that
sort2 is fastest than sort1 and sort3.
Obviously, Big O of sort is nlogn have the advantage to handle large data.


sort3 uses: Selection sort!

How do you know?:

Through I know sort1 is Bubble sort,when number has been sorted
however Selection sort need Big Ω (n^2) always slower than Bubble sort and Merge sort.
